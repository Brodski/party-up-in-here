# Set up  
### Before your first run  
  
```  
$ pip install virtualenv  
$ virtualenv venv  
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  
  
# Running   
  
```  
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
$ python .\main.py --which-action create --file myEmail_1.conf  
    OR  
$ python .\main.py --which-action like --file myEmail_1.conf  
```  
  
`--file` ==> filename in configs/...  
`--which-action` ==> "create" or "like"  

example
```
 python main.py --file myEmail_1.conf --which-action like
 python main.py --file myEmail_1.conf --which-action create
```


- in case  you dont know, you can cancel with ctrl+c in terminal
- comment out urls form LIKE_PAGES with # or //. ( highlight multi lines and ctrl+/ in your editor in case you didnt know)
- in your config file, `headless: True` = No graphics.  Idea is you can start up 10 or so programs simultaneously, with 10 differecnt config files
- there is a state file that saves your progress (`myEmail_1.conf.zstate.yaml`). Keeps track of where the app is in its process.

0:00 - demo "like" action
1:00 - demo "create" action
2:20 - demo "headless" config
4:10 - demo two programs running- set up
6:20 - two programs running, running
7:00 - you can end it here. I wanted to demo liking in headless mode, but I fucked up. Partial b/c microsoft's video screencapture UI got in the way of my terminal and I couldnt drag the window ðŸ˜ž
